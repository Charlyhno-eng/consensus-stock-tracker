# Stock Consensus Scraper

This is a **Next.js** application that scrapes stock market consensus data from **Boursorama** and displays it by sector.

The app fetches and displays analyst consensus for various stocks, organized by sector (Luxury, Health, etc.). Users can dynamically select a sector, and the app will scrape and display relevant data for all stocks in that category.
